# Fashion-Mnist-Classification-CNN
Use Keras and skopt to train and fine-tune a CNN structure.

1. Train a CNN with 2 convolutional layer and 1 fully-connected layer with Fashion MNIST data
2. Use skopt to search for the best the filter number of each convolutional layer (same for each layer) and learning rate
